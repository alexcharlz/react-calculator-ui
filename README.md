# react-calculator-ui
A simple react calculator in all dark mode

This react dark mode calculator is a simple ui concept. Using the ui is recommended, but under no circumstance should the evaluation code be used in production.
If production use is required, i'd highly encourage you rewrite the backend to something more suitable, as a simple javascript eval is far from a production ready code.
